# Fashion Muse Studio - Fixes Applied

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### 1. **Authentication Issues**
- App was trying to support anonymous users but database operations required authenticated users
- Generation process failed silently when anonymous users tried to generate images
- Database operations (`getUserCredits`, `deductCredits`) expected valid user IDs

### 2. **Database Errors**
- Anonymous user ID `'anonymous'` caused database lookup failures
- Generation records couldn't be created without valid user IDs
- Credit system failed for non-existent users

### 3. **Missing Configuration**
- Stripe credentials were not configured in environment variables
- S3 storage credentials were missing (optional)

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Require Manus OAuth Authentication**
- ✅ Changed `generations.create` from `publicProcedure` to `protectedProcedure`
- ✅ Added user authentication check: `if (!ctx.user) throw error`
- ✅ Restored login requirement on Home page
- ✅ Removed anonymous user handling code
- ✅ Updated Settings page to only show for authenticated users

### 2. **Database Operations Fixed**
- ✅ All generation operations now require valid authenticated user
- ✅ Credit checks work properly with real user IDs
- ✅ Generation records created with proper user ownership
- ✅ Delete operations verify user ownership correctly

### 3. **User Experience Improvements**
- ✅ Clear sign-in prompt: "Sign In with Manus"
- ✅ Proper loading states during authentication
- ✅ Better error messages for insufficient credits
- ✅ Greeting shows user's name from Manus account

## 🔧 Configuration Needed

### **Stripe Integration** (For Credit Purchases)

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your_stripe_secret_key>
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your_stripe_webhook_secret>
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your_stripe_publishable_key>
```

### **S3 Storage** (Optional - for permanent image storage)

If you want to use S3 instead of Manus storage:

```bash
S3_ENDPOINT=<your_s3_endpoint>
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_s3_key>
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_s3_secret>
S3_BUCKET=<your_bucket_name>
S3_REGION=<your_region>
```

## 🎯 Current App Flow

### **1. User Access**
1. User visits app → Sees sign-in page
2. Clicks "Sign In with Manus"

5. System checks credits
6. Uploads original to S3
7. Creates generation record in database
8. Generates images with Gemini AI (background process)
9. Uploads generated images to S3
10. Updates database with results
11. User sees results on Results page (auto-refresh)

### **3. Credit System**
- New users get 10 free credits
- Each image generation costs 1 credit
- Users can purchase credit packages via Stripe
- Super admins have unlimited credits
