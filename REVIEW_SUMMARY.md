## 🔴 Critical Fixes (Security & Logic)

| # | Issue | Fix | Status |
|---|-------|-----|--------|

| 2 | User authorization missing in `toggleFavorite` | Added ownership verification | ✅ Fixed |
| 3 | Unvalidated style/angle/lighting enums | Changed to strict enum validation | ✅ Fixed |
| 4 | JSON parse errors could crash queries | Added try-catch with fallback | ✅ Fixed |
| 5 | Placeholder URLs persisted on failure | Removed placeholders, fail gracefully | ✅ Fixed |
| 6 | Credits deducted but never refunded | Added `refundGenerationCredits()` function | ✅ Fixed |
| 7 | Gemini API fetch had no timeout | Added 60-second AbortController timeout | ✅ Fixed |

## 📂 Documentation Created/Updated

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | AI coding assistant instructions for project |
| `CODE_REVIEW.md` | 20 detailed issues with recommendations |
| `CRITICAL_FIXES.md` | 9 applied fixes with before/after code |
| `AGENTS.md` | Repository guidelines (existing, reviewed) |

## ✅ Quality Checks

```bash
pnpm check      # ✅ No TypeScript errors
pnpm format     # Ready for formatting
pnpm test       # Ready to run tests
pnpm build      # Ready to build
```

## 🎯 High-Priority Issues Still Pending

These remain in `CODE_REVIEW.md` for future work:

1. **Base64 URLs as originalUrl** – Upload image to S3 first
2. **No rate limiting** – Add express-rate-limit middleware
3. **Missing prompt sanitization** – Add length/content validation
4. **No pagination** – Implement cursor-based pagination
5. **Background job queue** – Consider Bull/bullmq for reliability
6. **Cookie domain** – Uncomment domain logic for production

## 🚀 Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate (This Sprint)
1. Merge the critical fixes
2. Test image generation flow end-to-end
3. Verify credit deduction/refund works correctly
4. Test authorization checks with multiple users

### Soon (Next Sprint)
1. Fix base64 URL handling (proper S3 upload flow)
2. Add rate limiting middleware
3. Add prompt input validation
4. Implement pagination for generation history

### Medium-term
1. Set up background job queue (Bull)
2. Add structured logging
3. Extract magic numbers to constants
4. Set up Sentry or similar error tracking
5. Add CI/CD with pre-commit checks
