# Generation Error Analysis

## Investigation Summary

### Issue
User reports errors when trying to generate images in the Fashion Muse Studio app.

### Findings from Investigation

#### 1. Frontend Code Analysis (GeneratePage.tsx)
- Image upload uses File API and FileReader to convert to base64
- Generation mutation calls `trpc.generations.create.useMutation()`
- Sends base64 image as `originalUrl` parameter
- Parameters sent: `originalUrl`, `imageCount`, `aspectRatio`, `prompt`, `style`, `cameraAngle`, `lighting`

#### 2. Backend Code Analysis (server/routers.ts)
- `generations.create` procedure expects:
  - `originalUrl`: string (currently receiving base64 data URI)
  - `imageCount`, `aspectRatio`, `prompt`, `style`, `cameraAngle`, `lighting`
  
#### 3. Potential Issues Identified

**Issue #1: Base64 vs URL Mismatch**
- Frontend sends base64 data URI as `originalUrl`
- Backend `generateWithGemini()` function expects a URL to download the image
- The function tries to `fetch(originalUrl)` which will fail with base64 data

**Issue #2: Missing Storage Upload**
- Images should be uploaded to S3 storage first
- Then the S3 URL should be passed to generation
- Currently skipping the storage step

**Issue #3: Gemini API Integration**
- `geminiImageGen.ts` expects to download image from URL
- Won't work with base64 data URI
- Needs actual HTTP URL or direct buffer handling

**Issue #4: Post-Processing Pipeline**
- Post-processing expects Buffer from downloaded image
- Won't work if image download fails

## Root Causes

1. **Primary**: Frontend sends base64, backend expects URL
2. **Secondary**: Missing S3 upload step before generation
3. **Tertiary**: Gemini integration not handling base64 input

## Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Add Storage Upload Endpoint
- Create tRPC mutation for uploading images to S3
- Return S3 URL after upload
- Frontend uploads image first, then uses URL for generation

### Phase 2: Update Generation Flow
- Modify frontend to upload image before generation
- Pass S3 URL instead of base64 to generation endpoint
- Add loading states for upload + generation

### Phase 3: Improve Error Handling
- Add better error messages for each step
- Show upload progress
- Display generation progress
- Handle failures gracefully

### Phase 4: Test End-to-End
- Test with real images
- Verify Gemini API integration
- Check post-processing works
- Validate credit deduction

## Implementation Priority
1. Fix storage upload (HIGH - blocks all generation)
2. Update frontend flow (HIGH - required for fix)
3. Improve error handling (MEDIUM - better UX)
4. Add progress indicators (LOW - nice to have)
